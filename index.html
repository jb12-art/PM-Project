            <p>
              The Community Science Museum makes science accessible through
              interactive exhibits that bring learning to life. From the
              fundamentals of nature to the vastness of space, the museum
              inspires curiosity and discovery. With over 1,000 exhibits,
              visitors can explore, experiment, and engage—except for the
              dinosaurs, who only wake up after dark!

            <p>For kids:</p>
            <p>
              Discover science in a fun, hands-on way at our museum! Ride the
              bumper swing to learn about Newtonian physics or meet our Woolly
              Mammoth. Join the Young Stars Club on Saturdays for experiments
              with experts, or take part in our themed holiday clubs for
              exciting adventures in science. Come ready to explore and learn!

            <p>For teachers:</p>
            <p>
              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please get in touch with us at the Contact us page, to find out
              more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your
              students through for a visit.

            <p>Energetica Exhibition on Loan:</p>
            <p>
              The Energetica Exhibition, on loan from the NEMO Science Museum in
              Amsterdam, is coming to the Community Science Museum. This
              interactive exhibit explores how we harness natural elements like
              solar and wind energy to generate power.
