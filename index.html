            <p>
              The Community Science Museum makes science accessible through
              interactive exhibits that bring learning to life. From the
              fundamentals of nature to the vastness of space, the museum
              inspires curiosity and discovery. With over 1,000 exhibits,
              visitors can explore, experiment, and engage—except for the
              dinosaurs, who only wake up after dark!

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.
